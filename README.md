# 10 Java Questions — Solutions

This repository contains a single Java program (`Main.java`) that implements and demonstrates solutions for 10 common Java practice questions. Each problem is implemented as a method and demonstrated in `main`.

Problems included:
1. Reverse a string
2. Check if a string is a palindrome
3. Compute factorial (BigInteger)
4. Compute Nth Fibonacci number (BigInteger)
5. Check primality and count primes up to N (Sieve)
6. Sort an array
7. Find max and min in an array
8. Check if two strings are anagrams
9. Compute GCD and LCM
10. Count vowels and character frequencies

How to compile and run
- Compile:

   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Java solutions for 10 questions"
   ```
2. Add remote (replace `<your-remote-url>` with your repository URL):
   ```
   git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
